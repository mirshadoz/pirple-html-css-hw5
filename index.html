                <h2>Ingredients for Polo</h2>
                <p>This is our <span class="special-class">traditional</span> East Turkistan's dish called Polo. It is very healthy and tasty, gives much energy for work and <span>amazing</span> taste. It is usually served with side salad. It is one of my favourite dishes and I can eat it half a pot, easily! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BljmNB7.png" width="50px"></p>

                <h2>Description of Why I love this dish Polo</h2>
                <p class="quoted-text">Polo, looks so organic orange and warm color of taste, with it's beautifully cooked rice. Fried and steamed meat at the top, gives this dish visual effect and assurance of real joy for meat lovers. Also, would like to note that this dish can be cooked for vegeterians as well, they simply won't add meat, but eat and enjoy Polo itself by its each bite.</p>
